# Differential Evolution Global Numerical Optimizer

This project is a differential evolution algorithm for numerically solving the global minima of non-linear, discontinuous, noisy, and dynamic objective functions. It is bench-tested with the Ackley function in n-dimensions. The design is standard for differential evoltuion:

Agent selection: Unique random uniform <br />
Mutation: Differential <br />
Survival: Deteminstic Elite <br />
